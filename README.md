# PythonCalculator
PyCulator is a GUI Python program that will create your own calculator.
I created this application for CS50s Final project.
PyCulator was designed based off a JavaScript Calculator that I built and tested. 
I debated just keeping the JavaScript and not using python since JavaScript can make thinks a little "fancy". But with the knew knowledge of Harvardx CS50 course I used python instead.
CS50 has been a wonderful course! Helping me get my hands onto new languages including Python, C, SQL, and Flask. I learned abbout Algorithms, Data Structures, Memory, Arrays, and used Scratch from MIT. With the knowledge ubtained from CS50 I will be continuing my education in computer science with other courses provided by Harvardx.
Thank you for your time, and this has been CS50.
